        buisnesses, and to ensure that both parties have a seemless experiance while contracting short work. Ergon <br>
        works as an intermediate for workers to come together, and exchange their services. This is done through our <br>
        aplication, which allows buisnesses to market their services, and for potential clients to look through each<br>
        of them, sorted by industry, and help clients to find the best fit them, and their needs. We here at Ergon <br>
        are commited to honest transactions between both parties, and hope that freelancers, buisnesses, and clients<br>
        alike will think of us when they need work or need work done!
